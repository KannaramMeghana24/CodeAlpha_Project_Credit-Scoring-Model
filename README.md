Credit Scoring Model

This repository contains datasets and notebooks related to building a Credit Scoring Model. The datasets include train.csv and test.csv, which are used for training and evaluating the model.

Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Ensure Python (>=3.7) is installed on your system.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/credit-scoring-model.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd credit-scoring-model

Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To use the credit scoring model:

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook "Credit Scoring Model.ipynb"

Execute each cell sequentially to:

Load and explore the dataset.

Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Train different machine learning models.

Evaluate model performance.

Generate predictions on test data.

Data Description

The train.csv and test.csv files contain financial data used for credit scoring. The key columns include:

Customer_ID - Unique identifier for each customer.

Age - Age of the customer.

Income - Monthly or annual income level.

Credit_Score - Historical credit rating of the customer.

Loan_Amount - Amount requested for the loan.

Employment_Status - Employment type (e.g., Full-time, Part-time, Self-employed).

Debt-to-Income Ratio - Ratio of debt to income, indicating financial stability.

Loan_Status - Target variable indicating whether the loan was approved (1) or rejected (0).

Model Overview

The credit scoring model predicts loan approval probability using machine learning techniques. The key steps include:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier removal, and data transformation.

Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical values, and creating new predictive features.

Model Selection: Evaluating different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Model Training: Splitting the dataset, training the models, and tuning hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess performance.

Predictions on Test Data: Applying the best-performing model to make predictions on new loan applications.

Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas - Data manipulation and analysis.

numpy - Numerical computations.

scikit-learn - Machine learning models and preprocessing.

matplotlib - Data visualization.

seaborn - Statistical data visualization.

xgboost - Gradient boosting algorithm for better accuracy.

Install them using:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost

Results and Evaluation

The model performance is assessed using various evaluation metrics:

Confusion Matrix - Visual representation of true vs. predicted classifications.

Accuracy Score - Proportion of correctly classified instances.

Precision, Recall, F1-Score - Measures to evaluate model reliability.

ROC Curve and AUC Score - Evaluates the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between approved and rejected loans.
